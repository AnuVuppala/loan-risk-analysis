Key Findings:
- Overall default rate: (see README)
- Credit Score < 600 corresponds to significantly higher default rates.
- EMI-to-Income ratio > 0.45 is associated with sharp increase in defaults.
- Past defaults raise probability of future default.

Recommendations:
1. Monitor EMI-to-income ratio and trigger early engagement if ratio crosses 0.35.
2. Create a dynamic risk score combining EMI ratio, credit score, and past defaults.
3. Offer EMI restructuring for high EMI ratio borrowers to reduce immediate default risk.
4. Use dashboard KPIs for early warning and collections prioritization.
